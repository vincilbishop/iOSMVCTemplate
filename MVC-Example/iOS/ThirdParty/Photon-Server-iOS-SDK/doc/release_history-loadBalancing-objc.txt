*** version 3.2.5.0
	Date: 10-16-2013
	- changed: instances of EGLoadBalancingRoom, EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom, EGLoadBalancingPlayer and EGLoadBalancingMutablePlayer now get constructed via factory functions, so that they can get subclassed by the app and the lib will then correctly create the subclass instances - override EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom:createPlayer(), EGLoadBalancingClient::createMutablePlayer(), EGLoadBalancingClient::createRoom() and/or EGLoadBalancingClient::createMutableRoom() when subclassing EGLoadBalancingPlayer, EGLoadBalancingMutablePlayer, EGLoadBalancingRoom and/or EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom
	- added: CustomAuthentication support
	- fixed: the entry for the local player in EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom.Players now references the same object as EGLoadBalancingClient.LocalPlayer, instead of holding a copy of that object, this avoids issues caused by missing synchronizations between two different copies
	- fixed: EGLoadBalancingRoom.PlayerCount has not been working when called on an instance of EGLoadBalancingRooms subclass EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom
	- added: parameterless optional callback EGLoadBalancingListener::onFindFriendsResponse(), which gets called when a friend list fetching operation has been finished so that the app knows, when EGLoadBalancingClient.FriendList will hold the fetched values
	- fixed: retain cycles between Client and MutablePlayer/MutableRoom


*** version 3.2.4.0
	Date: 08-01-2013
	- added: parameter playerNr to EGLoadBalancingListener::onPlayerPropertiesChange()


*** version 3.2.3.0
	Date: 07-08-2013
	- changed: the signature of EGLoadBalancingPeer::opRaiseEvent(), which now accepts every type as payload that is supported by Photons serialization, including (multi-dimensional) arrays, custom types and so on
	- changed: EGLoadBalancingPeer::opRaiseEvent() doesn't provide different overloads for targetActorNumbers and eventCaching + ReceiverGroup anymore, but the first one doesn't rule out the other 2 anymore and vice versa, so if you are using these parameters, please adjust your calls to the changes in the parameter order


*** version 3.2.2.2
	Date: 07-02-2013
	- fixed: creating/joining a room resulted in a crash when using tcp since 3.2.0.0


*** version 3.2.2.0
	Date: 05-06-2013
	- added: optional callback EGLoadBalancingListener::onRoomListUpdate()
	- added: optional callback EGLoadBalancingListener::onRoomPropertiesChange()
	- added: optional callback EGLoadBalancingListener::onPlayerPropertiesChange()
	- added: optional callback EGLoadBalancingListener::onAppStatsUpdate()
	- removed: optional parameter customLocalPlayerProperties from EGLoadBalancingClient::opCreateRoom(), EGLoadBalancingClient::opJoinRoom() and EGLoadBalancingClient::opJoinRandomRoom(); you should set custom local player properties through EGLoadBalancingClient.LocalPlayer instead
	- moved: local player access from EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom to EGLoadBalancingClient, as this way its more obvious, that local player poperties are not affected by joining or leaving rooms, but can be set in and outside of rooms and don't get reseted when switching rooms
	- added: EGLoadBalancingClient.FriendList
	- added: EGLoadBalancingClient.FriendListAge
	- added: class EGFriendInfo
	- added: EGLoadBalancingPeer::opFindFriends()
	- added: new optional parameter userID to EGLoadBalancinPeer::opAuthenticate()
	- changed: type of parameter propsListedInLobby in EGLoadBalancingPeer::opCreateRoom() and EGLoadBalancingClient::opCreateRoom() isn't NSArray anymore, but EGArray


*** version 3.2.1.1
	Date: 03-21-2013
	- fixed: LoadBalancingRoom.IsOpen and LoadBalancingMutableRoom.IsVisible have not been initialized correctly


*** version 3.2.0.0
	Date: 02-01-2013
	- note: your app now has to include LoadBalancing-cpp/inc, as LoadBalancing-objC now uses the enums folders from there instead of keeping its own redundant copies of them
	- optimized: all dynamic memory allocations now go through a custom memory manager, that is based on several memory pools, instead of direct calls to malloc/new/new[], internally these MemoryPools allocate chunks with increasing amounts of blocks per new nByte[]
	- fixed: some incompatibility with custom new/new[] overrides
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingClient into EGLoadBalancingClient
	- renamed: protocol LoadBalancingListener into EGLoadBalancingListener
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingPeer into EGLoadBalancingPeer
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingPlayer into EGLoadBalancingPlayer
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingMutablePlayer into EGLoadBalancingMutablePlayer
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingRoom into EGLoadBalancingRoom
	- renamed: class LoadBalancingMutableRoom into EGLoadBalancingMutableRoom


*** version 3.0.4.1
	Date: 12-27-2012
	- fixed: player properties have been broken in 3.0.4.0

	
*** version 3.0.4.0
	Date: 10-16-2012
	- changed: removed the printout of the payload for received events in LoadBalancingClient::onEvent(), as for events with a size of several kb stringifying the payload can get REALLY expensive
	- changed: static classes ErrorCode, EventCode, JoinType, OperationCode, ParameterCode, Properties::Player and Properties::Room into being namespaces with the same name, so that their static const members are stored at an addressable memory location
	- changed: after calling connectionErrorReturn() LoadBalancingClient will trigger a disconnect, if the client is not already disconnected or disconnecting, so that the app has not to call disconnect() itself anymore, before its able to reconnect in case of a connection error
	- fixed: a memory leak on receiving playernames of remote players when joining a room
